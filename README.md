# Bot-for-Discord-entry-security
This bot was created primarily to prevent people from entering the server and causing terrorism by posting pictures and links/spam. It is not a good solution for servers that automatically assign roles, but it was created to be used as a primary breakwater for servers of broadcasters or servers that assign roles separately.
